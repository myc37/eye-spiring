		question: "How old do I have to be to wear contact lenses",
		answer: "The average age people usually get contact lenses is 13, but it has been shown that some younger children are responsible enough to wear and maintain contact lenses. Successful lens wear depends more on responsibility and attitude than age. We recommend you contact your Eye Care Professional to determine if your child is a good candidate for contact lenses.",
	},
	{
		question: "Will contact lenses melt in my eyes?",
		answer: "Ever heard of contact lenses melting over a barbeque? Don’t worry, this is false. The lens material can only decompose at temperatures much higher than the boiling point of water.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can contact lenses get lost behind my eye?",
		answer: "Not a chance. In fact, it’s physically impossible. A membrane covers your eye and connects to the inside of your eyelids, so there’s no chance your contact lens will slide behind your eyes.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can contact lenses get glued to my eye?",
		answer: "Not likely. Contact lenses can be easily removed using the method your Eye Care Professional recommended. All it takes is practice and patience.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can contact lenses pop out of my eye",
		answer: "Not likely. With proper fitting, contact lenses should stay in place almost all the time. Even on that rare occasion when a contact lens moves out of place, it usually stays in your eye until you move it back.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can contact lenses scratch my eye",
		answer: "Such contact lens-related problems can occur, but they’re unlikely. Most common eye health issues are caused by poorly fitted lenses, or by not taking care of the lenses like you should. If you do experience any unusual eye discomfort or changes in your vision, remove your lenses and call your Eye Care Professional immediately.",
